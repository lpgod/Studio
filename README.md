simple Business Data Agent for decamond

how to run it (just writing stuff up i know you already know)

install the stuff it needs :

pip install langgraph langchain-core

 run the script:

python business_agent.py

this will run with the sample data inside the file and print a report

run the tests (to make sure it's not broken) :

python -m unittest business_agent.py

u should see an "OK" at the end.

that's that
